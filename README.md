# python-code-to-rotate-images-and-perform-ocr
Here is a simple Python code that uses the Pillow library to rotate an image and then uses the Tesseract library to perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the rotated image:
This code first imports the Image class from the Pillow library, which is used for image processing, and the image_to_string() function from the Tesseract library, which is used for OCR. It then opens the image file, rotates it by 90 degrees, saves the rotated image to a new file, and performs OCR on the rotated image. Finally, it prints the extracted text.
